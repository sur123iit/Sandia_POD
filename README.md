These codes have been applied to time-resolved velocity fields shared by Sandia National Laboratories. These velocities have been obtained by a technique called Pulse Burst PIV on flow over an open cavity. 
The codes are:

for applying modal decomposition techniques on time resolved velocity datasets of open cavity flows
